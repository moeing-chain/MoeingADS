### ESC Chain: Benchmarking MoeingADS with a real case

MoeingADS is the most important corner stone of Moeing chain. MoeingADS puts an upper bound for Moeing chain's TPS. You may want to know, when ignoring all the other factors (consensus engine, smart contract execution, etc) and only having MoeingADS in the critical path, how high can the TPS reach? Because no matter how hard we optimize the other parts of Moeing chain, its TPS cannot get higher than this upper limit.

Let's suppose there is a chain named "Extreme Stable Coin Chain" (ESC Chain). Its characters include:

1. It uses EOS-style DPoS consensus algorithm. A super node generates 100 blocks and then the next super node takes turn.
2. It does not support smart contracts.
3. It has one native token to pay gas fee and several other types of stable coins.
4. The amounts of coins are represented as 256-bit integers.
5. One account can own at most 20 types of stable coins.
6. The only transaction type is sending one kind of stable coin or the native token to another account, deducting sender's native token as gas fee.

When producing a block, a super node 1) collects the incoming transactions sent through P2P network, 2) execute the transactions and update the world state, 3) packs the executed valid transactions into blocks. Clearly these three steps can be pipelined and the second step is the most time consuming. The other two stages in the pipeline, step 1 and step 3, can hide their latency behind step 2.

By the way, although ESC Chain is rather simple, it is not a toy. If someone fully implements it and persuade WalMart, Amazon, Steam, Reddit and Twitter to use it, it would be a big business.

#### What the benchmarks do

We are not implementing ESC chain here. We just write benchmarks to mimic what is done in the most time consuming step 2. These benchmarks are enough to show how fast ESC chain can run.

The benchmarks simulate such a system: there are totally 100 stable coins, and $n$ accounts, each of which has 1~8 types of coins. The coins' amounts are initialized with random numbers. In each transaction, one account sends some amount of stable coin to another account. The amounts are chosen randomly but with constraints, such that the amounts do not overflow or underflow after sending, which means all the transactions are valid. In each transaction, 10 native tokens are deducted from the sender's account as gas fee, and the sender's sequence number is increased by one to prevent replay attacks. The transactions' digital signatures are not checked in the benchmark, because this task can be easily offloaded to other CPUs or other machines.

The benchmarks are:

1. **genacc**: to generate $n$ random accounts into the system. The generating process will continue for $n/20000$ blocks and during each block 20000 random accounts are generated.
2. **checkacc**: it reads the $n$ generated accounts out, in a randomized order. It can show the QPS (queries per second) MoeingADS can support.
3. **runtx**: it runs $m$ blocks, and each block has 32768 random valid transactions. It can show the TPS (transactions per second) MoeingADS can support.



#### How to run the benchmarks

To make the case more realistic, the test machine must have 16GB DRAM and about 300GB free SSD space. Such a machine can also run an go-ethereum client smoothly. The OS must be Linux or MacOS (Windows is not supported) and please install [golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [rocksdb](https://golang.org/doc/install) beforehand. The machine used in this article is a 2018 model MacBook Pro, with a 2.6GHz six-core i7 processor.

Step 0: check out the benchmarks' code and build executable. 

```bash
$ mkdir ~/benchmark; cd ~/benchmark
$ git clone https://github.com/moeing-chain/MoeingADS
$ cd MoeingADS/store/escchainbench
$ go build -tags cppbtree
```

After executing above commands, you'll have a executable file named `escchainbench` in the current directory.

Step 1: set some parameters.

```bash
$ export RANDFILE=path-to-a-large-file
$ export ACCNUM=$((328*1000*1000))
$ export BLKCOUNT=5000
```

RANDFILE is a large file used as random seeds. You can use a compressed archive file or a video file. ACCNUM is the total count of the accounts in the simulated system. We choose to use 328 million, which is roughly the population of U.S. BLKCOUNT is the number of blocks will be executed in test.

Step 2: generate the accounts randomly.

```bash
$ time -v ./escchainbench genacc $ACCNUM |tee gen.log
```

We use the `time` command to record how much DRAM is used by the testbench.

On this 2018 MacBook, `genacc` takes 6330 seconds to create the 328 million accounts and the maximum resident set in DRAM is 6856MB. Averagely 51817 accounts can be created in one second.

Step 3: test the query speed.

```bash
$ time -v ./escchainbench checkacc $ACCNUM |tee check.log
```

On this 2018 MacBook, `checkacc` takes 1048 seconds to read all the  328 million accounts, averagely 313K queries per second. 

Step 4: test the transaction execution throughput (TPS).

```bash
$ time -v ./escchainbench gentx $ACCNUM $BLKCOUNT |tee gentx.log
$ time -v ./escchainbench runtx $BLKCOUNT |tee runtx.log
```

First, `gents` generate blocks of random transactions and the `runtx` executes these transactions.

On this 2018 MacBook, `runtx` takes 6133 seconds to execute the 5000\*32768=163840000â€‹ transactions and the maximum resident set in DRAM is 7005MB. The TPS is 26714, which means 7 transactions for each account in one day. If each transaction costs 21000 gas (which is the intrinsic gas of an Ethereum transaction), then in 15 seconds 8.41491 billion (21000\*26714\*15 gas can be consumed. 

The `time` command shows "Percent of CPU this job got" is 516%. Since the CPU can support 12 threads, there are still plenty of parallelism to be exploit, for example, the step 1 and 3 running in parallel with step 2.

A block on Ethereum can consume at most 1250000 gas in 15 seconds. So ESC chain is about 673 times faster than ethereum in payment.

It can be expected that ESC chain runs much faster on a 2021 MacBook with [M1X processor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-macbook-pro-2021-release-date-price-specs-and-design-4112058).

#### Conclusion

We present a conceptual chain named ESC (Extreme Stable Coin) chain which focuses on stable coin payment. Benchmarks show that when built on MoeingADS, ESC chain can consume 8.4 billion gas in 15 seconds, which is 673 times faster than Ethereum.

ESC chain is an application-specific chain without smart contract support. Moeing chain is more powerful and thus has overhead. We do not expect it can run as fast as ESC chain. But 8.4 billion gas gives us enough confidence that Moeing chain can achieve the "one billion gas every 15 seconds" target in the middle term.
